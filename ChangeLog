= Revision history for hen

== 0.8.1 [2014-12-19]

* Removed workaround for RDoc issue 330. Implemented in RDoc 4.2.0.
* Renamed cross compile option +ruby_versions+ to +cross_ruby_versions+;
  defaults to all versions defined in rake-compiler's <tt>config.yml</tt>.
* When +cross_config_options+ given, cross compilation is implicitly disabled
  when they are empty or enabled when they are non-empty; override by setting
  +cross_compile+ explicitly.
* Added support for <tt>with_cross_<library></tt> options; specify a proc that
  accepts the <tt>WITH_CROSS_<LIBRARY></tt> environment variable, if set, and
  returns a single directory for <tt>--with-<library>-dir</tt> or an array for
  <tt>--with-<library>-include</tt> and <tt>--with-<library>-lib</tt> to be
  added to +cross_config_options+.
* Added support for +cross_compiling+ option.
* Added support for +local_files+ option, i.e., generated files that should be
  included in the package but not under version control.

  ignored.
