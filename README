= hen - Just a Rake helper

== VERSION

This documentation refers to hen version 0.8.7


== DESCRIPTION

Hen is a Rake helper framework, similar to Hoe[http://docs.seattlerb.org/hoe/]
or Echoe[https://github.com/evan/echoe]. It provides you with a set of common
Rake tasks by placing a little snippet like the following in your Rakefile:

  require 'hen'
  require 'your/lib/version'

  Hen.lay! {{
    gem: {
      name:    'gem_name',
      version: Your::Lib::VERSION,
      summary: 'Project summary',
      author:  'Your Name',
      email:   'you@e.mail'
    }
  }}

=== Generate a global configuration file

Hen will read configuration options from your global configuration file if
it's present. You can generate a minimal <tt>.henrc</tt> with the +hen+ script:

  hen config

This will create a new <tt>.henrc</tt> file in your home directory.

=== Create a new project

For new projects, you can also use the +hen+ script to create an initial
project directory for you that comes with default files and configuration:

  hen create path/to/your/lib

You can even provide a project template of your own:

  hen create path/to/your/lib path/to/your/template

In addition to that, +hen+ can setup your new project with Git support:

  hen create path/to/your/lib -g

See <tt>hen help</tt> for further information.

=== Extending Hen

You can even extend Hen with your own tasks. More on that later. (TODO)
